# TriFunction
Write a program that traverses a collection of names and returns the __first name__, whose sum of characters is __equal to or larger than__ a given number __N__, which will be given on the first line. Use a function that __accepts another function__ as one of its parameters. Start off by building a regular function to hold the basic logic of the program. Something along the lines of __Func<string, int, bool>__. Afterwards create your main function which should accept the first function as one of its parameters.
